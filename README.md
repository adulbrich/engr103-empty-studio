# Studio 2: Git and GitHub

This starts out as an empty repository when you accept it via GitHub Classroom (other than the `README.md` file, which you're reading right now). Follow the studio instructions to copy your work from Studio 1 into it, and then push it back here to GitHub.

The point is to help you familiarize yourself with the process by which you'll work on and submit programming assignments for this course.
